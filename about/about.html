          <h1>History of Marketplace</h1>
          <p>
            A marketplace or market place is a location where people regularly
            gather for the purchase and sale of provisions, livestock, and other
            goods. In different parts of the world, a marketplace may be
            described as a souk (from the Arabic), bazaar (from the Persian), a
            fixed mercado (Spanish), or itinerant tianguis (Mexico), or palengke
            (Philippines). Some markets operate daily and are said to be
            permanent markets while others are held once a week or on less
            frequent specified days such as festival days and are said to be
            periodic markets.

            Markets have existed since ancient times. Some historians have
            argued that a type of market has existed since humans first began to
            engage in trade. Open air, public markets were known in ancient
            Babylonia, Assyria, Phoenicia, the Land of Israel, Greece, Egypt and
            on the Arabian peninsula. However, not all societies developed a
            system of markets. The Greek historian Herodotus noted that markets
            did not evolve in ancient Persia.
